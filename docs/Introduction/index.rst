Introduction
============
DNA sequencing followed by whole-genome assembly and annotation is a critical first step for
understanding the connection between DNA and physical traits of individuals.  The `American Campus
Tree Genomes (ACTG) project <http://site.address.here>`_ is a national effort spearheaded by
`Alex Harkess <https://www.hudsonalpha.org/faculty/alex-harkess/>`_ of Auburn University and Hudson Alpha
to provide a curriculum that teaches new scientists, through hands-on experience, the computational
steps for whole-genome assembly, annotation. and scientific writing that culminates in a
research-ready genome assembly, and a publishable manuscript for submission to a scientific journal.
The project's focus is on trees that are beloved within a region, state, or university campus, but
the course provides training that is applicable for any species.  This document provides an implementation
of the ACTG curriculum.  Students will assemble and annotate a genome for a tree species.  Students will
contribute content to this manuscript and be included as co-authors on the final submitted manuscript.
