Software Installation: Praxis AI
================================
If you are using Praxis AI for this course you will be instructed to install individual
software as you need it using conda.  Conda makes software installation easy. You'll use
a similar set of commands to install everything. See the example for how to find a package
and install it on the :doc:`conda` page.
